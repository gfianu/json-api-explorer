How my code is different from the solution:
My code is more feature-rich and interactive compared to the solution. I included:
A “Fetch Posts” button to load posts on demand, instead of automatically fetching on page load.
Functionality to create new posts with live success/error messages displayed on the page.
Functionality to delete posts using event delegation.
Displaying more posts (top 10) and showing them in a styled container (<div class="post">).
Error handling for both fetching and posting data, with messages shown to the user.

The solution code is simpler: it fetches a limited number of posts on page load, uses alert() 
for post submission confirmation, and does not include delete functionality or live feedback.

What the solution code adds to my learning or understanding:
The solution demonstrates a simpler and clean approach for fetching and rendering posts, 
using concise functions like renderPosts() to handle the DOM efficiently. 
It shows how to limit API results (?_limit=5) and structure a minimal, functional app 
without extra features. Comparing both approaches helps me understand the trade-off between 
feature-rich applications and simpler, maintainable code, and reinforces how to organize functions 
for clarity and reusability.
